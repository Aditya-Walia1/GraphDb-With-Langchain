# GraphDb-With-Langchain
# Graph DB With Langchain Using Neo4j 🚀


## 🌟 Overview

This project combines the power of Neo4j's graph database with Langchain to create an innovative system for information retrieval and question answering. By leveraging graph structures, we're pushing the boundaries of how AI interacts with complex, interconnected data.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔗 **Neo4j Integration**: Harness the power of graph databases for complex relationship modeling
- 🧠 **Langchain Framework**: Seamlessly work with large language models (LLMs)
- 🕸️ **Knowledge Graphs**: Represent and query interconnected data efficiently
- 🔍 **RAG Implementation**: Enhance responses with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- 📊 **Vector Similarity Search**: Utilize vector databases for efficient similarity queries
